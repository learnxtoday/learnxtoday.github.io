This is a random collection of my thoughts, my work progress and how I go on about solving challenges. I am learning how to micromanage eerything at the moment, like hosting a blog, writing posts, building a portfolio website and stuff. I am also learning how to make an online presence, so that I build a community of people, who get motivated and learn along with me.

I have a lot of things in mind. I see of myself as someone who can make a major impact in the world and I wanna see how big of a footprint I can leave behind, call it my legacy.

I wanna implement a lot of things, and let's hope I don't deviate. Bear with me and enjoy this collection.
